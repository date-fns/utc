# @date-fns/utc

The package provides `Date` extensions `UTCDate` and `UTCDateMini` that perform
all calculations in UTC rather than the system time zone.

Using it makes [date-fns](https://date-fns.org) operate in UTC but can be also used without it.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @date-fns/utc --save
```

## Usage

`UTCDate` and `UTCDateMini` have API identical to `Date`, but perform all calculations in UTC, which might be essential when calculating abstract date-time, i.e for rendering chart or calendar component:

```ts
import { UTCDate } from "@date-fns/utc";
import { addHours } from "date-fns";

// Given that the system time zone is America/Los_Angeles
// where DST happens at Sunday, 13 March 2022, 02:00:00

// Using system time zone will produce 03:00 instead of 02:00 because of DST:
const date = new Date(2022, 2, 13);
addHours(date, 2).toString();
//=> 'Sun Mar 13 2022 03:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)'

// Using UTC will provide expected 02:00:
const utcDate = new UTCDate(2022, 2, 13);
addHours(utcDate, 2).toString();
//=> 'Sun Mar 13 2022 02:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)'
```

### Difference between `UTCDate` and `UTCDateMini`

Unlike `UTCDateMini` which implements only getters, setters, and
`getTimezoneOffset`, `UTCDate` also provides formatter functions, mirroring
all original `Date` functionality:

```ts
import { UTCDateMini, UTCDate } from "@date-fns/utc";

// UTCDateMini will format date-time in the UTC, like expected:
new UTCDateMini(2022, 2, 13).toString();
//=> 'Sun Mar 13 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)'

// UTCDate will format date-time in the UTC, like expected:
new UTCDate(2022, 2, 13).toString();
//=> 'Sun Mar 13 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)'
```

Even though `UTCDate` has a complete API, developers rarely use the formatter
functions outside of debugging, so we recommend you pick the more lightweight
`UTCDateMini` for internal use. However, in environments you don't control,
i.e., when you expose the date from a library, using `UTCDate` will be
a safer choice.

For instance, in date-fns locale functions (`format`, `parse`, etc.), we use
`UTCDateMini` to ensure the minimal build size.
