# @date-fns/utc

The package provides `Date` extensions `UTCDate` and `UTCDateMini` that perform all calculations in UTC rather than the system time zone.

Using it makes [date-fns] operate in UTC but can be also used without it.

Like everything else in the date-fns ecosystem, the library is build-size aware. The smallest component, `UTCDateMini,` is only `239 B`.

**Need more than just UTC?** See [@date-fns/tz](https://github.com/date-fns/tz) that provides full time zone support.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @date-fns/utc --save
```

## Usage

`UTCDate` and `UTCDateMini` have API identical to `Date`, but perform all calculations in UTC, which might be essential when calculating abstract date-time, i.e for rendering chart or calendar component:

```ts
import { UTCDate } from "@date-fns/utc";
import { addHours } from "date-fns";

// Given that the system time zone is America/Los_Angeles
// where DST happens at Sunday, 13 March 2022, 02:00:00

// Using system time zone will produce 03:00 instead of 02:00 because of DST:
const date = new Date(2022, 2, 13);
addHours(date, 2).toString();
//=> 'Sun Mar 13 2022 03:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time)'

// Using UTC will provide expected 02:00:
const utcDate = new UTCDate(2022, 2, 13);
addHours(utcDate, 2).toString();
//=> 'Sun Mar 13 2022 02:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)'
```

### Difference between `UTCDate` and `UTCDateMini`

The main difference between `UTCDate` and `UTCDateMini` is the build footprint. The `UTCDateMini` is `239 B`, and the `UTCDate` is `504 B`. While the difference is slight, and `504 B` is not significant by any means, it might be essential in some environments and use cases.

Unlike `UTCDateMini` which implements only getters, setters, and `getTimezoneOffset`, `UTCDate` also provides formatter functions, mirroring all original `Date` functionality:

```ts
import { UTCDateMini, UTCDate } from "@date-fns/utc";

// UTCDateMini will format date-time in the system time zone:
new UTCDateMini(2022, 2, 13).toString();
//=> 'Sat Mar 12 2022 16:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time)'

// UTCDate will format date-time in the UTC, like expected:
new UTCDate(2022, 2, 13).toString();
//=> 'Sun Mar 13 2022 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)'
```

Even though `UTCDate` has a complete API, developers rarely use the formatter functions outside of debugging, so we recommend you pick the more lightweight `UTCDateMini` for internal use. However, in environments you don't control, i.e., when you expose the date from a library, using `UTCDate` will be a safer choice.

## API

- [`UTCDate`](#utcdate)
- [`utc`](#utc)

### `UTCDate`

`UTCDate` mirrors all the `Date` API, so refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) for the full list of methods and properties.

### `utc`

The `utc` function allows to specify the context for the [date-fns] functions (**starting from date-fns@4**):

```ts
import { isSameDay } from "date-fns";
import { utc } from "@date-fns/utc";

isSameDay("2024-09-09T23:00:00-04:00", "2024-09-10T10:00:00+08:00", {
  in: utc,
});
//=> true
```
