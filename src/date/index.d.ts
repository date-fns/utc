/**
 * UTC date class. It maps getters and setters to corresponding UTC methods,
 * forcing all calculations in the UTC time zone.
 *
 * Combined with date-fns, it allows using the class the same way as
 * the original date class.
 *
 * This complete version provides not only getters, setters,
 * and `getTimezoneOffset`, but also the formatter functions, mirroring
 * all original `Date` functionality. Use this version when you need to format
 * a string or in an environment you don't fully control (a library).
 *
 * For a minimal version, see `UTCDateMini`.
